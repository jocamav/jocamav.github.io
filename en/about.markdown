description: José Carlos Martínez Vega - Desarrollador de Software
---

I'm José Carlos Martínez. I've been working as Software Developer since 2007. Since then I've been working using Spring Framework.
Lately I've been lucky to develop some projects in Angular too. 

Agile, TDD, Clean Code, Extreme Programming...I admit I was a bit skeptical in the beginning, but the experience taught me these concepts 
work for once reason.

Another thing I learn with the past of the years is there's no such thing as THIS IS THE WAY of doing the things. Different projects, 
different needs...different ways of providing the solution. My motto? **It depends...**
